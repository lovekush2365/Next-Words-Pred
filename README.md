# Next-Words-Pred
This project demonstrates a simple Next Word Prediction model using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented in Python. The model is trained on a dataset of text to predict the next word in a sequence based on the preceding words, showcasing the power of RNNs in handling sequential data. Using techniques like tokenization, word embedding, and sequential modeling, the project highlights how deep learning can be applied to natural language processing tasks. This application has potential use cases in predictive text, chatbots, and language generation systems.
