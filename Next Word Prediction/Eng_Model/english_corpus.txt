Did you hear about the new cafe that opened up on the corner of Maple Street? Yeah, I did! I heard they serve the best coffee in town. I'm excited to try it out. Me too! I'm a huge coffee enthusiast, so I'm always on the lookout for new places to get my caffeine fix. Speaking of caffeine, have you ever tried making your own espresso at home? I have, but I can never seem to get it just right. It's a delicate balance of grind size, water temperature, and pressure. Yeah, I've heard it's quite an art form. I usually just stick to my trusty drip coffee maker. Nothing beats the simplicity of a good old cup of joe. True, but there's something special about the ritual of making espresso. It's like a little morning meditation. Totally! It's a great way to start the day on the right foot. So, what have you been up to lately? Not much, just trying to stay busy with work and hobbies. I've been getting really into gardening lately. Oh, that's awesome! What are you growing? Mostly herbs and vegetables. It's so rewarding to see them grow from seed to harvest. I bet! There's nothing like cooking with fresh ingredients from your own garden. Speaking of cooking, have you ever tried your hand at baking bread? Yes, I have! There's something magical about the process of turning flour, water, and yeast into a delicious loaf of bread. I couldn't agree more. Plus, the smell of freshly baked bread filling your home is unbeatable. Absolutely! It's one of life's simple pleasures. So, have you been watching any good TV shows or movies lately? Actually, I just started watching this new series on Netflix. It's a psychological thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Oh, I love a good thriller! What's it called? It's called "Mindhunter." It's based on true events and follows FBI agents as they interview serial killers to understand their motives. That sounds fascinating! I'll have to add it to my watchlist. Definitely do! It's incredibly well-written and acted. Plus, it's filled with suspense and mystery. I'm hooked already! Thanks for the recommendation. No problem! Let me know what you think once you start watching it. Will do! So, any exciting plans for the weekend? Not really, just the usual errands and chores. How about you? I'm thinking of taking a day trip to the beach if the weather holds up. Oh, that sounds lovely! I could use some sun and sand myself. Yeah, it'll be nice to unwind and soak up some Vitamin D. Well, let me know if you want some company. I'd love to join you! That would be great! The more, the merrier. Alright, it's a plan then! I'll bring the sunscreen and snacks. Perfect! I'll see you on Saturday. Can't wait! It's going to be a blast. Alright, talk to you later! Bye!

Once upon a time, two brothers used to live in Persia. Their names were Ali Baba and Kassim. Kassim was the older brother. After their father’s death, Kassim said that it wasn’t Ali Baba’s home anymore. So, Ali Baba fled his home and climbed up the mountain to find forty thieves. The 40 thieves stood in front of the large rock and said, “OPEN SEESAME!” These magic words opened the rock, and the 40 thieves entered the cave. “What a sight!” Ali Baba thought.
Ali Baba approached the large rock after the thieves had left and said, “OPEN SESEAME!” The cave opened, and Ali Baba entered it. The cave was full of treasures. “Amazing!” Ali Baba exclaimed. He took some of the treasures with him and became rich.
Kassim learned about this and was jealous of his brother. He went to Ali Baba’s home and asked him, “Where did all this stuff come from?” Ali Baba, after some time, revealed the secret location to his brother. Kassim couldn’t wait and ran to the cave. “OPEN SEESAME!” he shouted, and the cave opened. He filled his bag with all the treasures.
When he was leaving, he saw that the large rock had locked the cave. Kassim tried to think of the secret words and tried saying everything, “OPEN DONKY!” OPEN MONKEY!” but it didn’t work. The thieves returned to the cave and found Kassim. The thieves killed him.
Ali Baba learned about his brother, took him out of the cave and buried him. The thieves learned that the body was gone and were angry. “Someone was there and took him”, they said, “Let’s find that person.” They soon found out it was Ali Baba.
One of the thieves finally found Ali Baba and robbed his home. Ali Baba’s maid was clever and marked all doors in the neighbourhood with the same marking as the one on their door. The thieves again arrived the next day to steal from Ali Baba but couldn’t find his house as all of the doors had the exact same marking. The thieves finally found Ali Baba’s house and entered. They hid in large jars. The maid saw them hiding and filled the jars with boiling oil. The thieves hiding in the jars died.
The chief of thieves was left. Ali Baba invited him to his house as a guest. Ali Baba didn’t know who he was, but his maid was able to identify him. “Be my guest!” said the maid, “Relax and enjoy the show!” She brought two swords and began to dance and moved closer to the chief of thieves as she moved. The maid then stabbed the chief and told the truth about his identity to Ali Baba.
The maid’s wisdom and help surprised Ali Baba. “Thank you for saving my life,” Ali Baba said and married her after some time. They lived happily ever after.

Long years ago, there lived in a distant land a handsome prince named Sunlight. Sunlight lived in a splendid palace with his father, the ruler of the land, who was called in those days a Khan. Sunlight's mother had died when he was a baby, and when he was a young boy his father married again. So Sunlight also lived with his stepmother, the queen, along with her son, a lad named Moonlight.
Sunlight's father and his stepbrother, Moonlight, loved him dearly, but his stepmother hated him with a passion. She desperately wanted her own son, Moonlight, to be the one to inherit the throne. So, while the two boys lived happily together, never suspecting evil, this wicked woman plotted and schemed to somehow be rid of Sunlight forever.At last, one day, she thought of a plan. Going to her room, she lay down, groaning and crying out as if she were sick and in frightful pain. The Khan was soon notified and was much alarmed when he found the queen in such a bad way.
"My dear wife!" he cried, "I will have the court doctor summoned at once."
"Nay," said the queen feebly, "it will do no good. Already I am near death, and none can help me. I am dying, my Khan - I know that I am dying fast, and the one and only cure for my sickness, alas! I can never have."
"One cure?" said the king. "If there is anything on earth which will help you, my dear, surely you shall have it! Only tell me what it is, so I may get it for you at once!"
She groaned again, this time gasping for breath. "It is more than your kingdom. It is of such a nature that I dare not speak of it." Then she writhed and shuddered as if in worse pain than ever, and the Khan was beside himself to see her suffering so.
"Tell me, my love, tell me!" he begged. "No matter what it is, you shall have it! You have my promise!"
"Sunlight has worked an evil charm upon me. I shall die this very night if I do not drink the blood from his heart!"
The Khan shrank in horror. He loved his eldest child Sunlight more than life itself, and to kill him would be impossible. Nevertheless, something must be done quickly.
"The queen," he thought to himself, "is mad; she must be humored, and I've already given my kingly word which must not be broken. I will have a goat killed instead, and its heart given to her. When she is well again, she will be as glad as I that I deceived her in this way!" So he drew near the queen and spoke reassuringly to her.
"My love, your life is more precious to me than that of many sons! You shall have the heart's blood of Sunlight this very night without fail. Meanwhile, try to sleep."
As he turned to the door, he met the queen's son Moonlight coming in. One look at the lad's face told the Khan that his last terrible words had been overheard. "I must explain my plan to the lad," he thought, but at that moment a messenger came to him bearing important news, and he straightaway forgot all about the boy.
Moonlight, however, was like one struck dumb with surprise and fear. He had indeed heard part of the conversation between the Khan and his mother, the queen, for the two had been talking loudly as he approached their door. He thought, of course, that his brother was in deadly peril. As soon as he had recovered from the shock of his discovery, he ran to find Sunlight and poured the whole story into his ears.
Sunlight was more grieved to hear that his own father would be willing to kill him, than he was worried about his own life, but there was no time to weep, for he must leave the palace at once and be far away in some safe hiding place by nightfall.
"I will go with you!" declared Moonlight.
"Nay," said Sunlight, with a grateful smile. "I do not know what dangers I may meet. You must not think of it!"
"What will home be without you, my dear brother? Your life shall be my life, whatever and wherever it takes us!"
There was no talking him out of it, so in a very short time the two lads had slipped quietly and secretly from the palace and were out in the wide world.
All that day they walked, and the next, and the next, sleeping at night wherever they could find shelter. On the third day. they came into a dry, huge desert, with no sign of human life to be seen anywhere, and nothing that could provide water or food. At last, exhausted, Moonlight stumbled and fell on the sand.
"Alas, dear brother," he said, "I can not go any farther. Bid me farewell and go on. There's no need for both of us to die!"Sunlight did not try to argue with his brother, but made him as comfortable as the hot desert would allow and bade him to be of good cheer and wait for his return, for he would surely find and bring back help. Then he began looking this way and that for some sign of a spring or a waterhole in the desert. At last, his eye was caught by a bright red something on the side of a rocky cliff not far away. He quickened his step to see what it might be and found that it was a great red door set deep into the face of the rock. He rapped upon the door, and soon it was opened by a kindly-looking old man.
Sunlight was so relieved to see another human being he could have kissed the old man's long, flowing beard. Quickly he told his story and begged the old man to help Moonlight. The hermit lost no time in walking with Sunlight back to where his brother lay. Together the two of them carried Moonlight back to the hermit's cave, where the old man used all of his skill to care for the exhausted boy until he was fully recovered.
So the two lads started a new life with the old hermit. Indeed, he soon declared that he could not love them any more if they had been his own sons. So the weeks and months passed, and the three of them lived happily together in their cave behind the red door in the desert.
It so happened that the biggest Khan of them all, that is, the ruler over the entire country, was a wicked, ill-tempered, suspicious man. Above all else this Khan hated and feared strangers, because it had been foretold that one day he would lose his throne and crown to some lad from a strange land.  And so he had made a law that any young man who entered his kingdom from another country would be seized at once by his soldiers and cast into a cave to be devoured by three fierce demon-bears.
At last, in some mysterious way, the Khan learned of two lads living with the hermit in his cave behind the red door in the cliff.
The old man noticed the Khan's soldiers coming across the desert and at once guessed why they were there. While the men were still far off, he ran quickly to the two boys and urged them to hide. Sunlight climbed into a barrel of mangos, crouching down until they covered him, and Moonlight hid in a sack of grain. When the soldiers pounded on the red door, the hermit allowed the soldiers to enter.
"Boys?" he said, in answer to their question. "I have no sons! I am an old man and have lived in this desert many a long year without wife or child to bear me company. You must be mistaken!"
The soldiers roughly pushed the hermit.
"You had better not lie to the Khan's soldiers!" the captain threatened.
"I have told you no lie," replied the hermit, "but if you doubt my word, come in and see for yourselves."
With a growl and an oath, the captain seized the hermit by his long white beard and shook him."So you thought you would give us the trouble of searching!" said he. "We'll do no such thing! I know there is a boy here, and my orders are to fetch him, so bring him out at once - and hurry up with it!"
He raised his sword over the hermit's head, but before he could swing it down, Sunlight leaped out from his hiding place, and caught hold of the captain's arm.
"Oho!" said the captain to the lad. "So you are here, after all!"
